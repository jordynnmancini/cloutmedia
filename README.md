## Description
What is Clout? It's a way to connect the music industry together like never before. It's a site made for creatives and harnessing connections between them. As a musician or musical artist, it is often difficult to connect with sound engineers - and vice versa. Not anymore! This app allows you to foster connections in order to grow your musical career. 

Our app is first being tested in 3 major music cities - Nashville, Los Angeles, and New York. It is also starting out with two basic types of music industry professionals - Musicians/Artists and Sound Engineers. Future developments of this app might include more cities, and expanding the type of industry professionals that can join and benefit from this platform.
